# Babylon iOS Automation engineer technical exercise

At Babylon, we firmly believe that **transparency** is a core value that should be present in everything we do, and hiring the best person should reflect that belief. That is why we've defined a clear and open technical exercise to be completed by candidates applying for an iOS automation engineer role. 

## Our expectations

Babylon aims to hire only the most qualified people. That doesn't mean that a candidate must have several academic degrees or years of experience. We value **potential** equally as much as **knowledge** and **experience**. Above all, we value one's ability to **think independently**, **solve problems**, and to **engage with colleagues**.

As such, these are the main areas the team will focus our assessment of candidates on:

- Technical expertise
   - Language (Swift) and platform (iOS)
   - Frameworks (UI testing with XCTest)
   - Knowledge of software testing practises (Manual and Automated)
   - Automation Architectural design patterns (Page Object Model, Cucumber)
   - Knowledge of iOS APIs
   - Knowledge of the development cycle
- Interest in sharing one's knowledge
- Interest in learning new competences
- Interest in keeping oneself up to date
- Ability to think and work independently
- Ability to work in a large team
- Professional and personal maturity
- Overall attitude
- Likelihood of fitting in well with the company's culture
- Is the candidate someone we would like to work with on a daily basis?

## The Technical Exercise

### Application

To begin with please download the following open source [application](https://github.com/khoren93/SwiftHub) and setup your environment. This will demonstrate your understanding of Xcode and building iOS application.

### Existing Tests

The project currently contains a number of UI test cases, for these tests we would like you to complete the following:

- Add a comment to each test outlining what is being tested, do you feel the test is appropriate or well written. (do that in the documentation comment for these tests)
- Fix and/or improve the test if you feel it requires fix or improvement

### New Test Cases

As another part of the test we would like you to improve test coverage of the app by adding new tests as follows:

- Create new tests to cover the scenarios you feel are more relevant
- Write an in code comment as to what the test covers

### Automation Concepts

We would like to access your knowledge of the XCTest framework and how an applications code can be developed to improve testability and reliability. While not required it would help if you could demonstrate the following while completing the previouse exercies. 

- Understanding of XCTest and it's APIs
- How the application code interacts with automation
- Improvments to the application code to facilitate testing
- UI automation in the iOS context
 
# Outcome

Once you have finished the technical exercise please zip your project and send it to us for review via the recruiter who initially contacted you.

We really appreciate and value the time a candidate spends to complete the test and we guarantee that any test will be carefully reviewed by our team of engineers. 

Always expect to hear back from us.

In the possibility that a test doesn't meet the Babylon standards, we will always give feedback detailing what we think are the good aspects of the test and what we think should be improved.

#### We look forward to hearing from you!
