#Babylon 
# iOS Automation engineer technical exercise

At babylon, we firmly believe that **transparency** is a core value that should be present in everything we do, and hiring the best person should reflect that belief. That is why we've defined a clear and open technical exercise to be completed by candidates applying for an iOS automation engineer role. 

## Our expectations

Babylon aims to hire only the most qualified people. That doesn't mean that a candidate must have several academic degrees or years of experience. We value **potential** equally as much as **knowledge** and **experience**. Above all, we value one's ability to **think independently**, **solve problems** and to **engage with colleagues**.

As such, these are the main areas the team will focus our assessment of candidates on:

- Technical expertise
   - Languages (Swift, Java) and platforms (iOS)
   - Frameworks (UI testing with XCTest)
   - Knowledge of software testing practises (Manual and Automated)
   - Automation Architectural design patterns (Page Object Model, Cucumber)
   - Knowledge of iOS APIs
   - Knowledge of the development cycle
- Interest in sharing one's knowledge
- Interest in learning new knowledge
- Interest in keeping oneself up to date
- Ability to think and work independently
- Ability to work in a large team
- Professional and personal maturity
- Overall attitude
- Likelihood of fitting in well with the company's culture
- Is the candidate someone we would like to work with on a daily basis?

## The Technical Exercise

### Application

To begin with please download the following open source [application](https://github.com/khoren93/SwiftHub) and setup your environment. This will demonstrate your understanding of Xcode and building iOS application.

### Existing Tests

The project currently contains a number of UI test cases, for these tests we would like you to complete the following

- Add a comment to each test outlining what is being tested
- Describe if you feel the test is appropriate or well written
- Improve the test if you feel it requires improvement
- Verify the state of the test

### New Test Cases

For the net stage we would like you to add new tests to improve coverage

- Create any new tests you feel are appropriate
- Write a explanation as to why the test is needed and what it covers

### Framework

For the final stage we would like to understand your knowledge of how UI automation works on iOS and how tests interact with the application

- Make any improvements you feel are appropriate to the following and clearly stating why:
 - Update the test framework
 - Update the application to improve testing

 
# Outcome

Once you have finished updating the automation in the project please zip up your project and send it to use for review via the recruiter who initially contacted you. 

#### We look forward to hearing from you!
