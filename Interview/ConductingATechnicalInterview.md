How to Conduct a Technical Interview
====================================

### Remember what You Want to Achieve
In an interview you always want the candidate to do well. It is important that you approach the interview in a positive mode. To leave your desk a little bit earlier to give yourself a change to relax a bit, maybe get a cup of tea or coffee. The last thing you want to do is to rush to the interview really pissed off about a rude, mystery compilation error Xcode throw in your face.

Best possible outcome from an interview is a new hire who makes great contributions to your organisation, your team and thrives as a member in your team. In this section I will try to say something about the mindset required to interview a candidate successfully.

### Be Prepared
When a candidate arrives at Babylon for an interview he or she has already made a big effort. A candidate will probably have had to take time off work, may have had to travel a long way to get here and have made the effort to prepare and send us a sample of their work. The candidate will always have invested a lot more effort into the interview than you will do. To not set off enough time to prepare for the interview is very disrespectful.

For an interview around skills and knowledge about technologies I want to know about the candidate's education and previous work experience. I try to look for any technologies that the candidate knows about that I am unfamiliar with. If there are any I like to have a quick look at a product spec or something similar.

Reviewing the candidate's sample work I prefer to not read their CV. Instead I want to focus on what I think can be improved in their sample project. Again I am especially interested in discussing any libraries or design patterns that I am not familiar with.

For a cultural interview I like to know a bit about where the candidate is from, type of eduction and general experience. I do, however, not want to read the CV or sample project. This is to avoid being too biased about what to expect from the candidate. If I for some reason cannot get our internal recruiter to supply this information I prefer to tell the candidate that in order to have an unbiased discussion I have not looked their CV, cover letter or sample project.

### Make the Candidate Feel Welcome
Discuss what we can do to make a probably nervous candidate feel welcome and respected.

### Look for what the Candidate can bring
Diverse teams are well known to be more productive so when interviewing we are interested to learn about experiences and knowledge that we currently don't have in the team. At the same time we need new hires to be able to work with the technology we are using. Realistically, candidates who bring in a wealth of knowledge about technology we are not using will not also be experts in the technology. How can we think about structuring an interview with these somewhat conflicting goals.

but at the same time a new hire should enough about the technology we use for their intended level. How can one think about structuring an interview to learn something about what the candidate brings that we don't have already while not forgetting to ask about essential skills.

###  Let the Candidate have the Floor
- It is not your interview
- It is not your chance to take a step forward in your career
- Showing off your skills to a candidate is never going to earn you a pay rise or promotion. Save your boasting for your next one-to-one with your line manager.

### Think about Our Brand
