How to Conduct a Technical Interview
====================================

### Remember what You Want to Achieve
Best possible outcome from an interview is a new hire who makes great contributions to your organisation, your team and thrives as a member in your team. In this section I will try to say something about the mindset required to interview a candidate successfully.

### Be prepared
To not prepare for an interview is simply rude. How to best prepare does, however, depend on the kind of interview.

### Make the Candidate Feel Welcome
Discuss what we can do to make a probably nervous candidate feel welcome and respected.

### Look for what the Candidate can bring
Diverse teams are well known to be more productive but at the same time a new hire should enough about the technology they use for their intended level. How can one think about structuring an interview to learn something about what the candidate brings that we don't have while not forgetting to ask about essential skills.

###  Let the Candidate have the Floor
- It is not your interview
- It is not your chance to take a step forward in your career
- Showing off your skills to a candidate is never going to earn you a pay rise or promotion. Save your boasting for your next one-to-one with your line manager.

### Think about Our Brand
