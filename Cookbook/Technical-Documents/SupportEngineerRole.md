# Support Engineer Role

As iOS Engineers, we have Squad related work and we also have iOS Chapter work.

The iOS Team duties are as important as Squad duties, although in some occasions one can have priority over the other.

When an engineer is on support, these duties have higher priority over Squad duties, however this can change if there is critical Squad work to be done. In this case, the Support Engineer can ask an iOS Chapter Lead to be replaced in their support duties.

## Duties

* **Update the #ios Slack channel's topic** The topic should be updated to show the Support Engineer for the current day. This should be done first thing in the morning.
* **Be available to answer any requests posted in the #ios channel.** The engineer can either solve the request or delegate to someone who might know how to solve it.
* **Pick up tickets from the iOS Platform backlog.** These are tickets that don't have any Squad as an owner and still need to be fixed, or ones for which the Platform team might need some help with.
   * Use this [Kanban board](https://babylonpartners.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1509) to see the list of pending BAU tickets.
   * But first, ping the platform team directly on Slack to check with them if there is any urgent/blocker ticket that could use some help and would take priority.
   * Discussion of tickets and progress should be posted in #ios-support-info. This channel is used to share knowledge about a tasks progress and potential issues.
* **Work on personal goals.** Personal goals should be tasks that will help you improve competences in your preferred areas. They are also important tasks that are used, in addition to other metrics, to evaluate your performance. You should only work on these if there is no other task to be picked up from the points defined above and there is no critical work to be done as part of your Squad.
* **Support handover to next support engineer.** Details / progress on outstanding tasks should be posted on the ticket / in the #ios-support-info channel for the next support engineer to finish off. This prevents us from having multiple half-finished tasks sitting in the backlog without an indication of progress made.

## Schedule

A support engineer schedule restarts every sprint.
Every engineer on support is in this role for two consecutive days.

The days an engineer is on support are defined as following:

* **Support Engineer 1** - Monday and Tuesday
* **Support Engineer 2** - Wednesday and Thursday
* **Support Engineer 3** - Friday and Monday
* **Support Engineer 4** - Tuesday and Wednesday
* **Support Engineer 5** - Thursday and Friday

The schedule is defined in the iOS Team Plan document and calendar events are also added to the iOS Developers Outlook calendar.

Please let your squad know with a week's notice if you are being assigned to Support
