# Support Engineer Role

As iOS Engineers, we have Squad related work and we also have iOS Chapter work. The iOS Team duties are as important as Squad duties, although in some occasions one can have priority over the other.

## The duties

* **Be available to answer any requests posted in the #ios and #ios-usa-support.** The engineer can either solve the request or delegate to someone who might know how to solve it.
* **Pick up tickets from the iOS Platform backlog.** These are tickets that don't have any Squad as an owner and still need to be fixed. [Kanban board](https://babylonpartners.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1100&projectKey=IOSP)
* **Work in personal goals.** Personal goals should be tasks that will help you improve competences in your preferred areas. They are also important tasks that are used, in addition to other metrics, to evaluate your performance. 

## The schedule

A support engineer schedule restarts every sprint. 
Every engineer on support is in this role for two consecutive days.

The days an engineer is on support are defined as following:

* **Support Engineer 1** - Monday and Tuesday
* **Support Engineer 2** - Wednesday and Thursday
* **Support Engineer 3** - Friday and Monday
* **Support Engineer 4** - Tuesday and Wednesday
* **Support Engineer 5** - Thursday and Friday
