# Support Engineer Role

As well as **Squad-related** work, we (iOS engineers) have **iOS Chapter-related** work.

In order to make time for the latter, we have introduced the **Support Role**. Once in a while, every iOS engineer goes on support duty for **two consecutive days** during which Chapter work is prioritised â€“ unless there are critical Squad tasks to be done. In that case, the Support Engineer can ask an iOS Chapter Lead to find someone to replace them.

##### Key Things to Remember:

1. The first thing in the morning that an engineer must do on Support Role is to update the #ios channel's description with their name 
2. Let your squad know with a week's notice if you are being assigned to Support Role

##### Key Slack Channels:

1. **#ios** (for Support Engineer reference)
2. **#ios-support-info** (for Support duties discussion)



## Duties

* **Be available to answer any requests posted in the #ios and #ios-support-info channels.** The engineer can either solve the request or delegate to someone who might know how to solve it.
* **Pick up tickets from the iOS Platform backlog.** These are tickets that don't have any Squad as an owner and still need to be fixed, or ones for which the Platform team might need some help with.
   * Use this [Kanban board](https://babylonpartners.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1509) to see the list of pending BAU tickets.
   * But first, ping the platform team directly on Slack to check with them if there is any urgent/blocker ticket that could use some help and would take priority.
   * Discussion of tickets and progress should be posted in #ios-support-info. This channel is used to share knowledge about a tasks progress and potential issues.
* **Work on personal goals.** Personal goals should be tasks that will help you improve competences in your preferred areas. They are also important tasks that are used, in addition to other metrics, to evaluate your performance. You should only work on these if there is no other task to be picked up from the points defined above and there is no critical work to be done as part of your Squad.
* **Support handover to next support engineer.** Details / progress on outstanding tasks should be posted on the ticket / in the #ios-support-info channel for the next support engineer to finish off. This prevents us from having multiple half-finished tasks sitting in the backlog without an indication of progress made.



## Schedule

The schedule is layed out before the start of each sprint and can be found in both the **iOS Team Plan document** and the **iOS Developers calendar**.

The Support Role days are as follows:

* **Support Engineer 1** - Monday and Tuesday
* **Support Engineer 2** - Wednesday and Thursday
* **Support Engineer 3** - Friday and Monday
* **Support Engineer 4** - Tuesday and Wednesday
* **Support Engineer 5** - Thursday and Friday
