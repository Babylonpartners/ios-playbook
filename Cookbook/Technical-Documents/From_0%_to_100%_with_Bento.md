 Outline of "From 0% to 100% screen with Bento"

## Why & when to use Bento?
I'd like to inform the reader as to why developing a screen with Bento will take less time than writing it from scratch.

### Examples from our code
Provide examples of our app & code what screens are written in Bento and link them here as a reference point 

### Bento & SwiftUI
Small explanation on what our team's current approach to adopting SwiftUI looks like. This will be a be a short section saying that Bento will eventually replaced by SwiftUI (in few years perspective).

## How to use BabylonBoxViewController, ViewModel & Renderer
Section when I'd like to describe how to setup a typical RAF module with strong focus on `Renderer` part.
I want this section to be a guide with code samples, line by line, how to write a renderer.

### Keywords in Bento
- What are `Screen`, `Box`, `Section`, `Node`.
- What is a `BabylonBoxViewController`?
- What is `AnyRenderable`
- What Operators can I use?

## Writing a custom component (optional)
**Introduction** to Design Library. Why is it there and how is it related with Bento? How can I write my own component if I need a custom component? Here I'll mention what Atomic components are.

## BabylonBoxViewController from scratch (optional)
Note: I'm still thinking if that should be a part of the article.
Rarely, but sometimes, we cannot use `BabylonBoxViewController`. I'd like to guide how a simple implementation of custom ViewController can look like. Maybe, the example would use UICollectionView instead of UITableView which is used by `BabylonBoxViewController`

## Outline notes
- The order of section may change in the article. I'd like to make this article about 1k words long. 
- Naming of sections may be changed in the future (to sound better)
- Sections marked as `(optional)` may be skipped if I find the article gets too big and overwhelming.
- Once it's accepted by @scass91 and @RuiAAPeres I'll change the PR to be "draft" and I'm going to work on the article in this file below the `----`. Before the final merge I'm going to delete the outline.
