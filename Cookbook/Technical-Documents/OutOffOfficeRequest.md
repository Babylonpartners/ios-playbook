# Requesting and Notifying Out Of Office time

Someone who is Out Of Office means that they are not in their usual work place at their usual working hours. This can be when someone goes on holidays or when someone that usually works in the office is working from somewhere else.

OOO time has to be requested and approved by your Line Manager and your Project Manager.

There are different types of OOO and each one of them have different requirements for requesting and for being notified.

## Holidays 

As per contract, we are entitled to 25 holiday days per year. You can book your holidays at your convience, you might just need to sync first with your Squad and the other iOS engineers to see if everybody is OK with it. 

Ideally, you should give at least 2 weeks notice before taking any holiday but there are exceptions for emergency situations. If you want to book more than 5 consecutive days you ideally should give 4 weeks notice.

### Steps to request

1. Ask for approval from your PM - only if approved you can proceed to the next steps.

## Working from Home
This section is only valid for non-remote employees.

Working from home is a benefit and should be seen as such. 
At the moment it is accepted that an engineer, once settled in the iOS Team processes, project, and squad is allowed to work from home 1-2 days per week. 
The number of days may very depending on your personal situation and your squadâ€™s way of working. These should be discussed and agreed with your Line Manager and your PM.

When working from home you should notify in the the iOS team Slack channel when you are away and when are you expecting to come back.

### Steps to notify

Notify the iOS Team and your Squad via Slack on the working day before you are working from home. 
Emergencies might happen that require you to work from home and only notify on the same day. That will be acceptable if there is a plausible reason for it.
