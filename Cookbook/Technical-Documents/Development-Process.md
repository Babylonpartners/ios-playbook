# Development Process

Babylon follows the [SSDLC](https://engineering.ops.babylontech.co.uk/docs/standards-ssdlc) when developing our software. To make the process easier, we use tools and services to link code changes to tickets.

There are 3 services we use daily:
- Jira: this is where the development begins. Once a ticket has all the necessary details, dev can pick it up and implement it. <!-- TODO: [CNSMR-3230] link to Jira article -->
- GitHub: used for hosting our project
- CircleCI: our continuous integration service to run tests when integrating PRs <!-- TODO: [CNSMR-xxxx] link to CircleCI article -->
