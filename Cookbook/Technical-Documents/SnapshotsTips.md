# Snapshot Testing tips

## What are snapshot tests?

We're testing visual layer of our apps by using snapshots. Snapshots in our case are images of screens and UI components. They are stored in PNG files.

We're using [SnapshotTesting](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing) library from pointfree to record and compare our snapshots.

This kind of tests help us catching any regressions in visual appearance. For example they are very useful when working on a component which might be used on many screens.

## Tips

### Building UI

Until we adopt [SwiftUI previews](https://nshipster.com/swiftui-previews/), snapshots are the fastest way to work iteratively on new UI. 
Using snapshot tests as feedback mechanism when building UI is much faster than compiling, launching full app, and verifying appearance only then.

Sample workflow for adding a new screen can look like this:

1. **Initial setup**
      - Add files for a new screen from following templates: BentoBox and RendererSnapshotTests.
    -  Set `recordMode` to `true` in snapshot test - you'll be making a lot of changes.
2. Build UI in [renderer](https://github.com/babylonhealth/ios-playbook/blob/master/Cookbook/Technical-Documents/Architecture.md#renderer) based on state.
    - üîÅ **Repeat until done**: make your changes small and run snapshot test to record any significant changes ("[Test again](https://github.com/babylonhealth/ios-playbook/blob/1a88e2e0090aee3128df70f84dddb7c038f7f15b/Cookbook/Technical-Documents/XcodeTips.md#testing)" shortcut is very handy here). Verify changes by checking newly recorded snapshot. 
3. Once ready set `recordMode` to `false` in snapshot test and make sure to commit image for reference.


### Reviewing snapshot tests in PRs

It's important for us to review new snapshots and snapshot changes during code reviews. GitHub UI doesn't make it easy - PNG images with snapshot files are by default collapsed when you're viewing PR changes. Here's a handy bookmarklet you can use to open all those snapshots at once. 

1. Drag the link to your bookmarks bar.

[[GitHub] show rich diffs](https://github.com/babylonhealth/ios-playbook)

2. Update address with the JS snippet:

```js
javascript:Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName('btn%20btn-sm%20BtnGroup-item%20tooltipped%20tooltipped-w%20rendered%20js-rendered')).forEach(function(button)%7Bbutton.click()%7D);
```


To test it you can check this [PR](https://github.com/babylonhealth/ios-playbook/pull/303/files) - it contains a few images with diagrams.

*Looks like GitHub doesn't allow JS links, that's why instruction has two steps.

### Testing with localization

It's possible to use snapshot to verify that screens look correct with real world data and localized copies.

On one hand it means that snapshot will fail when we update a copy, on the other hand it makes sure that someone will check whether this screen still looks correct after a copy change.

To do that you'll need to have translations available in tests. Setting this up involves switching bundle(s), for example see `TestAppointmentLocalizationBundleUpdater`.

### Testing configurations

Before adding a snapshot test consider is it worth to test all possible device combinations for a given state.

Let's that say we implement 2 secondary states for a new screen - loading and error state. 3 devices x 2 states x 2 visual styles = 12 new snapshots. It's often the case that the secondary screens only display screen's title, a loading or empty state component, maybe a few components which are already tested in primary state snapshots.

The lower-level components for loading and error states are already pretty well tested, so sometimes a single snapshot per device for a state like this may be enough. In this example the number of snapshots would go from 12 to 4 and we could still be pretty confident that UI works fine in those states.

Keep in mind that number of snapshots can explode very quickly and can harm running time of tests. If you record a lof of snapshots, then it's also possible that not all of them will be checked during code reviews.
