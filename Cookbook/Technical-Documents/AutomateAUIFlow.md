# Testing Conventions (UI Automation) [DRAFT]

When we work on a story, we will automate the happy path using UI testing XCTest. Explain why here

# Define Test Scenarios

Explain how QA and dev work together 

# The three levels of autoamtion

Explain the three levels of code need to automate a flow and what they do and what api they use, including why

## Featue Files

## Step Deinfitions

## Screen Objects

# Test Scheme

Maybe explain the test scheme and environments

# Writing your feature file

The first stage is to write your `test scenario` which will either need to be added to an exsisting feature file or a new one created. Feature files follow the naming convention `feature``subfeature`Feature.swift 

# writing your step deinfitions and screen objects if needed

# How and when do we run UI tests
