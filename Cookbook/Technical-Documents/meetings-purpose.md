# iOS Meetings Purpose

As an engineer part of the iOS Chapter Team we have to collaborate with each other. The work we do in each of our squads contributes to the whole product and at the end of the Sprint we are all releasing the same app, together, as a team. 
We should all be focused in delivering the work assigned from our squad and at the same time we should try to engage with the other iOS Engineers to keep the communication channel opened for any comment/question we might have.
We have scheduled a set of iOS Team specific meetings to ensure we communicate with each other, are aware of the process and follow it and to allow us to raise any issue or make an announcement.

The list of our meetings and a brief description of it's purpose:

* **iOS Retro:** The place where we can raise anything that went well or not so well in our last 2 weeks of work. This can be anything related with the iOS Team in general or something from our Squads in particular but that we feel is relevant to raise. Some of the issues you have in your squad are common to other squads. Those can be raised in this meeting to understand if itâ€™s something that can be addressed. Additionally, the good achievements we have in our squads can and should also be raised in the retro so everyone is aware of the good work everyone is doing.

* **Main PR Party**


* **iOS Lunch & Learn**
