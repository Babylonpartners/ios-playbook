# iOS meeting outcomes

A place to store all the outcomes from the iOS chapter meetings, in reversed chronological order.

Please always be mindful of not leaking sensitive information here. Double-check with your teammates to be sure, if you need to.

### Banter, 19 Sept 2019
iOS support engineer to tackle smaller BAU tickets during support down-time.

Team activities TBD.
### Proposal: split octopus, 19 Sept 2019
Rejected as the amount of work to move octopus to its own framework is not worth the time. Splitting octopus will, instead, be tackled squad by squad with smaller pieces of work (e.g. Payments, GPaH).

### Lunch and learn, 19 Sept 2019
A [trello board](https://trello.com/b/7INoC8YK/improvements-architecture-process) with architecture and process improvements. Issues to be prioritized by @AnnKatF.
