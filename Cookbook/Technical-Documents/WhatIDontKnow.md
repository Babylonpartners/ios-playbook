# What I don't know, but should

## Congratulations you‚Äôve joined Babylon...
Welcome to the amazing iOS team!¬†
Babylon is a fast-growing company as you could see we are onboarding ~ 30 people weekly many of them engineers like yourself. Our team is scattered across three offices: London West, London East and US office. On top of that, we have fully remote teammates. As you can imagine this poses almost biblical challenges, but don‚Äôt worry :)

## Like others before you...
The first week may be difficult, all of the reading and chatting make for a bit of a mind-numbing first experience. We don‚Äôt promise the information firehouse stops after the first day, but just hear what people who get through are saying:

Q: What did you like during your first week?
> ‚Äú1-on-1 with Rui and squad PMs, meet team, talk a lot within the squad, pair with a couple of people on iOS team. Gone out to drinks with the squad :)‚Äù

> ‚ÄúI found the team to be very helpful in the first while becoming familiar with the code ...‚Äù

> ‚ÄúWorking in my squad on real tickets from day one‚Äù

> ‚ÄúQuickly started working on an actual project, smooth onboarding because of the iOS playbook, people being extremely helpful and welcoming, 1st day with the team‚Äù

> ‚ÄúTeam welcoming both iOS and squad‚Äù

## You‚Äôll never walk alone‚Ä¶
As you will notice due to the rapid growth things in Babylon can and will change often and quickly.¬†While this may look scary do not worry you are working with amazing people and everyone wants to help you. You have the right to ask questions and seek out help from people in the team and other co-workers. To make this task easier here‚Äôs, an incomplete, list of people that can help you.

### Your manager
Your manager will be the first person from the iOS team that you‚Äôll see after the induction workshop on your first day.¬†He, or she, should introduce you to your buddy, your squad and other co-workers.

- [iOS Onboarding Line Manager Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cu_e1Ol4nkpDNawQOeCbho9xg5L02-1k-Y1YCZjBZ_c/edit#gid=0)

Why you should read it: This will tell you how your first 3 months at Babylon should look like.

### Your buddy
When you start you will be paired up with a colleague with some tenure at Babylon.¬†
Think of this buddy as your mentor, as the go-to person if you have any questions. They should answer technical questions, introduce the team, and even walk you through some code or pair programming.

- [iOS Buddy Onboarding Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nKxNwAWdscPjIDOqrKpyU7zefF1fBuad0STXe2R0WiA/edit#gid=0)

Why you should read it: This will give you a good idea what you can expect during your onboarding.

How to be a good buddy?

>Treat it as you would introduce a friend new to your city: Introduce them to locals, give them some resources so they can navigate on their own, and help them form a plan their first few weeks.

### Your squad
You may be still confused by the name, but a squad is an awesome group of people with who you will be working with. Get to know them well during your onboarding time. They will be more than happy to explain and help you with day-to-day work. Check what are your squad slack channels, calendar groups and JIRA board and make sure that you are added to them.

### The iOS team
One of the greatest sources of our collective knowledge is a #ios-questions slack channel. You can ask there any question and the whole team will try to help you.

## In the tower of Babel
When working in such a vibrant and dynamic environment it is very easy to lose a track of things that should happen. This is a shortlist of topics that should help you to get through the onboarding time.

### Communication and Collaboration
Effective and open communication is crucial in a company like Babylon. Without it, everything falls apart. If there is one thing you should remember from this guide let me suggest this:
Context is king!

When you‚Äôre communicating digitally, you never quite know what the other person is doing at that moment. They might be at their desk just like you are, or they may be frantically rushing to a meeting, only responding ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to your question and not elaborating because they don‚Äôt have time.

Without understanding the other person‚Äôs context, you might think that person doesn‚Äôt care about the issue you brought up when they‚Äôre really just running to a meeting room. With the information on that person‚Äôs context, all of a sudden, the curt answers make sense: It‚Äôs not that your coworker doesn‚Äôt care, they are just indisposed at the moment.

Prefacing communication with your context can help to prevent any miscommunication when things are out of the ordinary. Let team members know when you are heads down on a project and can‚Äôt respond to questions right away.

Over communicating is always better than making assumptions.

To help you with a difficult art of digital communication, here are some resources for you:
