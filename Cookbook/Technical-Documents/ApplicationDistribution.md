# Application Distribution
This document is for any Babylon iOS developers who wish to distribute our applications, or for any partners who wish to gain access to our applications.

## How to gain access to iOS applications
### External Babylon partners
* If you are an external partner of Babylon, please speak with your Babylon contact who will arrange this for you

### Babylon Employees
* If you are a Babylon employee, please reach out to the current iOS support engineer(s) in the #ios slack channel
* You will also need to have [App Center](https://github.com/babylonhealth/ios-playbook/blob/simon/cnsmr-3226/Cookbook/Technical-Documents/AppCenter.md) installed

## Distribution of iOS applications
### Distributing to a Babylon employee
* Ask the person who is requesting access for their `@babylonhealth.com` email address
* Follow [this guide](https://github.com/babylonhealth/ios-playbook/blob/simon/cnsmr-3226/Cookbook/Technical-Documents/AppCenter.md#adding-people-to-the-organisation) to invite them to our App Center builds

### Distributing to an external partner
* **Please ensure external partners only receive testflight builds, do not send App Center builds externally**
* Ensure the external partner has [testflight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) installed on their device
* Within [AppstoreConnect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) (login details within 1Password), add the user(s) to the relevant distribution group
* Within the user distribution group in Testflight on AppstoreConnect there will be a link to invite the user to our build, once they are added to the relevant group, please use this link to invite them to install our build via Testflight
