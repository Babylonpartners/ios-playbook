iOS Playbook ðŸ“š
==================================

At Babylon, we firmly believe that **transparency** is a core value that should be present in everything we do. This playbook embodies that value by giving an overview on how we work:

1. Who's in the team.
2. Which squad each individual belongs to and availability.
3. Release process.
4. Technical documents.
5. New hires checklist.
6. Interview process.
7. Code guidelines, standards and etiquette.
