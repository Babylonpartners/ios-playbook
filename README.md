iOS Playbook üìö
==================================

At Babylon, we firmly believe that **transparency** is a core value that should be present in everything we do. This playbook embodies that value by giving an overview of how we work:

1. Who's in the team.
2. Which squad each individual belongs to, and its availability.
3. OSS-maintained projects.
4. Release process.
5. Technical documents.
6. New hires checklist.
7. Interview process.
8. Code guidelines, standards and etiquette.


## 1. Who's in the team

## 2. Which squad each individual belongs to, and its availability.

By definition, members work on their respective squad, although they are free to work in different squads if the work load justifies it.

## 4. Release process

### Release engineer as a role

  The release engineer responsibilities are, but not limited to:

  1. Own the entire release process (step-by-step).
  2. Provide visibility, at all stages, of the release to the wider audience (e.g. squad, tribe and iOS chapter lead).
  3. Collaborate with QA by:
    1. Providing visibility to potential blockers to the wider audience.
    2. Escalating abnormal influx of bugs, so the release, as a whole, can be reassessed.
  4. Making sure he/she can dedicate enough time for the release. In case this is not possible (due to other squad commitments), please inform the iOS chapter lead.

### Release calendar

Effort to release should be broken down by:

1. Automated QA effort (e.g. `5h`)
2. Manual QA effort (e.g. `3h`)
3. Delta between the jira ticket being open and marked as `done` or `wont fix`, for Engineering effort. (e.g. `UA-8289: 1h30`)
4. Total effort


| Version                  | Release Engineer(s)              | QA effort              | Engineering effort | Total effort |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------| ---------------------- |--------------------|--------------|
| 3.2.0                    | Danilo Aliberti                  | Automated: `12h53`<br>Manual: `10h`<br>| `UA-8166: 4h`<br>`UA-8149: 2d`<br>`UA-8187: 3h`<br>| Total: **3d6h** |
