iOS Playbook ðŸ“š
==================================

At babylon, we firmly believe that **transparency** is a core value that should be present in everything we do. The iOS's playbook embodies that value by giving an overview on how we work:

1. Who's part of the team.
2. Which squad each individual belongs to and availability.
3. Release process.
4. Technical documents.
5. New Hires checklist.
6. Interview Process.
7. Code Guidelines and Standards.
