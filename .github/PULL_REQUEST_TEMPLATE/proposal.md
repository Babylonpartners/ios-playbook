* [ ] I will send a meeting invitation, using this [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babylonhealth/ios-playbook/master/Cookbook/Proposals/Template_Proposal_Meeting_Invitation.md), scheduled for 2 weeks after this proposal is made, so an agreement can be reached.
* [ ] **By creating this proposal, I understand that it might not be accepted**. I also agree that, if it's accepted,
depending on its complexity, I might be requested to give a workshop to the rest of the team. ðŸš€
