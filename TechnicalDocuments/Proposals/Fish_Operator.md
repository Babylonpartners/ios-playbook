# Introduce "fish" operator (Kleisli composition)

* Author: Ilya Puchka

## Introduction

This proposal it to suggest to use new operator that will allow us to compose functions returning optional values, which is not currently possible.

## Motivation

Since introduction of `>>>` operator it was widely adopted throughout the code base and became an important tool in our tool set. But there are some cases where it's not enough. 

One of these cases is when the first function returns optional, which makes us to jump through the hoops like this:

```swift
didTap: helpText.map { ^Action.didTapWhatDoesThisMean($0) >>> observer }
```

or use verbose optional unwrapping chains with if-let or guard-let. 

## Proposed solution

To handle such case [Prelude](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-prelude) defines "fish" operator (with a help of free curried `flatMap` function):

```swift
infix operator >=>: ForwardComposition

public func >=> <A, B, C>(lhs: @escaping (A) -> B?, rhs: @escaping (B) -> C?) -> (A) -> C? {
  return lhs >>> flatMap(rhs)
}

public func flatMap<A, B>(_ a2b: @escaping (A) -> B?) -> (A?) -> B? {
  return { a in
    a.flatMap(a2b)
  }
}
```

This is called [Kleisli composition](https://blog.ssanj.net/posts/2017-06-07-composing-monadic-functions-with-kleisli-arrows.html) and is very common in functional programming.

With this we can convert our example code above to much simpler form:

```swift
didTap: ^helpText >=> Action.didTapWhatDoesThisMean >=> observer
```

When we break down the types we will see the following:

```swift
(() -> String?) >=> ((String) -> Action?) >=> ((Action) -> Void)
```

This code will not compile as it is though as Swift treats `() -> A` and `(()) -> A` as different types. And even if it would treat them the same the final function that is created by this chain has signature `() -> Void?` which is not the same as `() -> Void`.

To solve that we can wrap the whole chain in a closure and invoke it with `()` argument:

```swift
didTap: { ^helpText >=> Action.didTapWhatDoesThisMean >=> observer <| () }
```

Alternatively we could use a regular composition and write it as following:

```swift
didTap: { helpText ?|> Action.didTapWhatDoesThisMean >>> observer }
```

Even though the last option seems a bit better it does not mean that Kleisli composition can be always replaced with regular composition combined with other operators. The value of Kleisli composition is that it allows composition on functions which will not be composed with regular composition `>>>` because one of them returns result wrapped in some container (it can be `Optional`, `Either` or other kinds of types that wrap value of another type in some way).

This can be most usefull to replace chains of optional unwraping:

```swift
// (A) -> B?
func doSomething(_ value: A) -> B? {
  guard let thing = someOptionalThingFromA(value)
    // possibly more failable operations here...
    else { return nil }
  
  return maybeCreateBfromThing(thing)
}

let a: A = ...
let b: B? = a |> doSomething
```

With Kleisli it can be written much simpler:

```swift
// (A) -> B?
let doSomething = someOptionalThingFromA >=> maybeCreateBfromThing

let b: B? = a |> doSomething
```

## Impact on existing codebase

As it is a new operator and not an overload of existing `>>>` operator there will be no impact on exicting code.

## Alternatives considered

- We can leave things as they are.
- Instead of free `flatMap` function we can use `{ $0 ?|> rhs }`
- Instead of passing `()` into composed function or using a closure with regular composition (`>>>`) we can have a function, something like `runLazy`, that wraps the side effect into a closure that discards the result (which is the nature of user action callbacks anyway). It is lazy because just `run` will imply that side effect will be performed right away, rather than wrapped in a closure to be performed later.

```swift
func runLazy<A>(_ f: @escaping () -> A) -> () -> Void {
    return { _ = f() }
}
```

Such function will solve the issue of `Void?` return type, but we still will have the issue with `Void` input type. For that we either can adjust this function to be `runLazy<A>(_ f: @escaping (()) -> A) -> () -> Void`, or we can intrduce an overload version of `>=>` operator:

```swift
public func >=> <A, B>(lhs: @escaping (()) -> A?, rhs: @escaping (A) -> B?) -> () -> B? {
    let f = lhs >>> { b in b.flatMap(rhs) }
    return { f(()) }
}
```

With that the final result will look like this:

```
didTap: ^helpText >=> Action.didTapWhatDoesThisMean >=> observer |> runLazy
```

Though just using closure with regular composition (`>>>`) seems to be the best option (in this particular case).

* [x] I will send a meeting invitation, using this [template](Template_Proposal_Meeting_Invitation.MD), scheduled for 2 weeks after this proposal is made, so an agreement can be reached.
* [x] **By creating this proposal, I understand that it might not be accepted**. I also agree that, if it's accepted,
depending on its complexity, I might be requested to give a workshop to the rest of the team. ðŸš€
