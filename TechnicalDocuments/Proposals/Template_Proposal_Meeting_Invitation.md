Hi all,

  a.	If you haven’t read the proposal, or don’t care for the outcome, please don’t show up for the meeting.
2.	If you want to make a counter proposal, or raise a change, please provide those in written to all meetings participants beforehand.
  a.	Ideally this is done via a PR comment.
  b.	Meetings notes (or PR's comments) can only be provided 2h before the meeting.
3.	Questions should be asked on the PR, not during the meeting.
4.	**The purpose of the meeting is to act as a sync point and a final outcome for the proposal itself.**
  a. Comments can be made, but at this point, the author should have a good idea if the proposal is to move forward or not.

Location:

Zoom link to be provided before the meeting.

Outcome:

By the end of this meeting, we will either close the proposal or accept it. If accepted, <Proposal's Author> needs to draft a plan to make this a reality. 

Thank you all!
